# Week 8 note

## TODO list

1. using pretrain model
2. trying to predict a new picture from internet
3. the classic paper reading

## Chap 5.3 Using a pretrained convnet

This may be your first encounter with one of these cutesy model names—VGG, ResNet, Inception, Inception-ResNet, Xception, and so on; you’ll get used to them, because they will come up frequently if you keep doing deep learning for computer vision.

There are two ways to use a pretrained network: feature extraction and fine-tuning

How to defend it?

* GAN

## Ch6 Text model

### What are the domin issues

1. text is sequential. So the model needs to be designed with time.
2. variably input. the input size is not fixed.

Solution:

* RNN -> Solve the time stemp issue
* One hot encoding -> Solve the variably input
