# Week 9

Student: Li-Chi, Chang
Professor: Zesheng, Chen

## Todo List

1. searching voiceprint in deep learning on the internet
2. RNN in text book(ch6)
3. CNN in MIT camp
4. dig into the paper of Adversial deep learning

## Voiceprint

I found a paper which is trying to use open database to train a model to do the voiceprint detection. It is a IEEE paper.
<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7994971>(This is the most cited paper)

And I also found the voiceprint detection concept.

Via the first document, I found some demos on GitHub

* <https://github.com/GauravWaghmare/Speaker-Identification>
* <https://github.com/lucko515/speech-recognition-neural-network>
* <https://github.com/bedangSen/VoiceSens>

**Note at 3/21/2020**
I didn't dig into the detail of these demos, I will check them in days.

## RNN in text book



## CNN in MIT camp

In the course3,4. They introduced the CNN and GAN and other generated model.

## Dig into the paper of Adversial deep learning
